## STEP 1: ASK
### How Can a Wellness Technology Complany Play It Smart?

### 1a. Background
Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products, was founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur. Bellabeat smart products collect data on activity, sleep, stress, reproductive health, and more to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. 

Sršen believes that an analysis of Bellabeat's available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data of non-Bellabeat smart devices in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

### 1b. Business Objectives
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

### 1c. Business Task
To determine how consumers are using non-Bellabeat smart devices in order to design a new marketing strategy that can be applied to one of the Bellabeat products based on the insights found from analysis of non-Bellabeat smart devices.

### 1d. Key Stakeholders 
- **Urška Sršen**: Bellabeat's cofounder and Chief Creative Officer
- **Sando Mur**: Mathematician and Bellabeat's cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team

## STEP 2: PREPARE
### 2a. Data Source
Sršen encourages me to use public data that explores users' daily habits. The dataset for this case study will be the [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CCO: Public Domain) that is found on Kaggle. This dataset is made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic).

### 2b. Description of Dataset
- Generated by respondents from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between March 12, 2016 to May 12, 2016
- Consists of 18 files that contains personal tracker information from 30 fitbit users which includes, but is not limited to: minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring, daily activity, steps, and heart rate. 

### 2c. Does the Data ROCCC?
### 2d. Final Selection of Data Files
